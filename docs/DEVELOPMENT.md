# Development guide

Season Challenger is a pnpm monorepo in TypeScript.

| Path              | What it is                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `packages/shared` | Domain types and pure game rules: squad validation, fantasy points, contest ranking, Season Mastery grading, ratings and tiers |
| `packages/feed`   | `FootballFeed` interface with two adapters: `FakeFeed` (offline) and `FotMobFeed` (live data)                                  |
| `packages/wallet` | Coin ledger, rewards, tournament categories, prize tables and settlement, voucher redemption rules                             |
| `apps/api`        | NestJS REST API and the Drizzle database schema                                                                                |
| `apps/mobile`     | Expo (React Native) app with Expo Router                                                                                       |

## Requirements

- Node 22 (see `.nvmrc`) and pnpm 10 (`corepack enable` picks the pinned version)
- Docker, for Postgres (optional: without `DATABASE_URL` the API keeps everything in memory)

## First run

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
pnpm test            # all unit and API tests
pnpm dev:api         # API on http://localhost:3000
pnpm dev:mobile      # Expo dev server; press w for web, or scan the QR code with Expo Go
```

The app signs in with a Bangladesh mobile number and a six-digit code. In development no text is
sent: the API prints the code in its log (`[SMS] to +880 1712-***678 (+8801712345678): 482913 is
your Season Challenger code...`). Use any valid-looking number, e.g. `01712345678`, and a different
number per test phone to play against each other.

On a physical phone, set `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` to your computer's LAN address, for example
`http://192.168.1.20:3000`, because `localhost` on the phone is the phone itself.

## The football feed

Two adapters sit behind the `FootballFeed` interface, chosen with `FOOTBALL_FEED`.

`fake` (the default) serves a deterministic league: same seed, same clubs, players, fixtures and
match stats on every machine. Its season starts five weeks before today, so there are always
finished fixtures with points and upcoming fixtures with open deadlines.

`fotmob` reads live scores and stats from FotMob. Set the league with `FOTMOB_LEAGUE_ID` (47 is the
Premier League; the number is in the FotMob URL, `fotmob.com/leagues/47/overview/premier-league`)
and optionally pin a season with `FOTMOB_SEASON` (for example `2026/2027`). Without a season the
adapter uses the one FotMob treats as current, falling back to the newest season that actually has
fixtures.

```bash
FOOTBALL_FEED=fotmob pnpm dev:api
```

The adapter reads FotMob's public site API (`/api/data/leagues`, `/api/data/teams`,
`/api/data/matchDetails`). That API is unofficial and unversioned, so:

- all mapping lives in `packages/feed/src/fotmob/map.ts`, away from the network, and is tested
  against recorded payloads;
- responses are cached by URL (30 s for the league, 15 s for a live match, 24 h for a finished
  match, 6 h for a club page), so a page view never turns into a burst of upstream calls;
- our ids are prefixed (`fm-club-8650`, `fm-player-319784`, `fm-fixture-4813374`), so the
  provider's ids stay in one place.

Two things FotMob does not supply are filled in deterministically: a player's credit price comes
from their market value on a fixed log scale inside their position's band, and outfield players'
goals conceded are charged in proportion to the minutes they played (FotMob reports that stat for
keepers only). A finished match is stored as stats snapshot version 1000; a live one uses the
elapsed minute, so a later correction adds a version rather than overwriting the one grading used.

With `DATABASE_URL` set, the API reads football data from Postgres and a worker inside the API
syncs it from the provider every `WORKER_SECONDS`. Only the sync calls the provider. Stats
snapshots are append-only by version, and an advisory lock lets one instance write at a time.

## API

| Method | Path                             | Notes                                             |
| ------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/health`                        | Status and active feed                            |
| GET    | `/v1/season`                     | Season info and current gameweek                  |
| GET    | `/v1/fixtures?gameweek=&status=` | Fixtures with both clubs                          |
| GET    | `/v1/fixtures/:id`               | Fixture with both squads                          |
| GET    | `/v1/fixtures/:id/points`        | Fantasy points per player, finished fixtures only |
| POST   | `/v1/squads/validate`            | Checks a squad; locked once the fixture kicks off |

### Sign-in

Players sign in with Google, or with a phone number and a texted code.

| Method | Path               | Notes                                                                  |
| ------ | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/v1/auth/methods` | `{ phone, google: { webClientId } \| null }`: what the app should show |
| POST   | `/v1/auth/google`  | `{ idToken }` from Google; returns `{ token, expiresAt, user }`        |

Google sign-in is on when `GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID` is set. The API checks each ID token's signature,
expiry, issuer and that its audience is that web client id; the Android app and the web app both
request tokens for it. A Google account maps to one player by Google's stable account id, so a
changed email address keeps the same player. In production without a real `SMS_PROVIDER`, phone
sign-in is switched off (`phone: false`, `/v1/auth/code` answers 503 `phone_unavailable`), and the
API refuses to start if neither Google nor a real SMS provider is configured.

Google Cloud setup: create OAuth clients in one project: a **Web** client (its id goes in
`GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID`; add your web app's address under authorised JavaScript origins) and an
**Android** client for package `com.seasonchallenger.app` with the SHA-1 of the key that signs the
APK. The Android client is never referenced in code, but Google refuses sign-in from the APK
without it.

#### Phone codes

| Method | Path                | Notes                                                                 |
| ------ | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/v1/auth/code`     | `{ phone }`; texts a six-digit code. Accepts `01712345678` or `+880…` |
| POST   | `/v1/auth/verify`   | `{ phone, code }`; returns `{ token, expiresAt, user }`               |
| POST   | `/v1/auth/sign-out` | Ends this device's session                                            |
| GET    | `/v1/me`            | The signed-in account: id and phone number                            |

Signed-in routes take `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Sessions last 90 days; the server stores
only a hash of each token and of each code. A code works once, for five minutes, and stops after
five wrong guesses. A number can get one code a minute and five an hour, and one address 20 an
hour. Errors come back as `{ error, message }` with `invalid_phone`, `too_many_codes`
(`retryAfterSeconds`), `sms_failed`, `wrong_code` (`attemptsLeft`), `code_expired`,
`too_many_attempts` or `signed_out`.

The first sign-in links the number to a new player; the 500-coin bonus is paid on their first
wallet view as before.

Codes go through an `SmsSender` (`apps/api/src/auth/sms.ts`). `SMS_PROVIDER=console` (the
default) writes them to the log, and production refuses to start with it, as it does without an
`AUTH_SECRET` of 32+ characters. `SMS_PROVIDER=sslwireless` sends real texts through SSL Wireless
SMS Plus (API v3 single send) and needs `SSLWIRELESS_API_TOKEN` and `SSLWIRELESS_SID` (the sender
id) from the SSL Wireless panel; `SSLWIRELESS_URL` overrides the host, e.g. for a sandbox. Keep the
token in your deployment's secrets, never in the repo. Set `TRUST_PROXY=true` behind a load balancer so the per-address
limit sees client addresses.

In development (`AUTH_MODE=dev`, the default outside production) the API also accepts an
`x-user-id` header as sign-in, for tests and scripts. Production ignores it.

### Coins, tournaments and vouchers

| Method | Path                            | Notes                                                               |
| ------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/v1/economy`                   | How coins work: bonus, rewards, categories, voucher rules           |
| GET    | `/v1/me/wallet`                 | Bonus and won coins, check-in streak; first call pays the 500 bonus |
| GET    | `/v1/me/wallet/activity`        | Coin history, newest first                                          |
| POST   | `/v1/me/check-in`               | Daily reward, once per Dhaka calendar day                           |
| GET    | `/v1/me/verification`           | ID check status: unverified, pending, approved or rejected          |
| POST   | `/v1/me/verification/documents` | Upload NID or passport photos (front and back, or one photo)        |
| POST   | `/v1/me/verification`           | Dev only (404 outside `AUTH_MODE=dev`): verify at once from details |
| GET    | `/v1/me/entries`                | Your tournament entries with points, rank and prize                 |
| GET    | `/v1/me/vouchers`               | Your vouchers with status                                           |
| GET    | `/v1/contests?fixtureId=`       | Public tournaments for a match; full ones are replaced by a copy    |
| GET    | `/v1/contests/:id`              | Tournament with its leaderboard once locked                         |
| GET    | `/v1/contests/invite/:code`     | Find a private tournament                                           |
| POST   | `/v1/contests`                  | Create a private tournament                                         |
| POST   | `/v1/contests/:id/entries`      | Enter a squad; pays the fee in coins                                |
| GET    | `/v1/vouchers/offers?category=` | Shop and travel offers; signed in, says whether you can redeem      |
| POST   | `/v1/vouchers/redeem`           | `{ offerId, requestId }`; won coins only, retry-safe                |

Tournaments lock at kick-off (cancelled and refunded if they did not reach their minimum) and
pay out when the match is final. The worker does this every `WORKER_SECONDS`, and reads do it
too, so a tournament never waits on a tick.

### ID check

Players upload their ID for review; set `KYC_REVIEWER_TOKEN` and open `/review` to approve or
reject. Photos are encrypted at rest. See [KYC.md](KYC.md).

### Season Mastery

| Method | Path                            | Notes                                                       |
| ------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/v1/mastery/cards?fixtureId=`  | A match's card of 5 to 8 calls; results only once graded    |
| PUT    | `/v1/mastery/cards/:id/answers` | Answers every call; changeable until kick-off, pays once    |
| GET    | `/v1/me/mastery`                | Your rating, tier, progress and graded matches              |
| GET    | `/v1/mastery/leaderboard`       | Season table by display name, for players with enough cards |

Cards are generated from a hash of the fixture id, so they need no clock or randomness. Only calls
the stats can resolve are generated, so there are no formation calls: no feed supplies formations
yet. The worker grades finished matches and records the stats snapshot version used. A later
correction does not change a graded card; regrading is not built.

### Partner portal

`apps/portal` is where shops and travel companies accept vouchers: `pnpm --filter @season/portal dev`.
A voucher code alone is not enough. The holder taps "Show at the till" for a 6-digit code that lasts
about 2 minutes, and the cashier needs both, so a code sold or screenshotted stops working.

There is no self-sign-up. Create a partner and its first staff member with:

```bash
pnpm --filter @season/api partner:create -- --id acme --name "Acme" --category shop --email owner@acme.example --staff "Owner name"
```

It asks for nothing else: the password comes from `PARTNER_PASSWORD` (12+ characters).

| Method | Path                          | Notes                                                        |
| ------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| POST   | `/v1/me/vouchers/:id/present` | Holder only: the short code to show at the till              |
| POST   | `/v1/partner/auth/login`      | Staff email and password; rate limited                       |
| POST   | `/v1/partner/auth/logout`     | Ends the session                                             |
| GET    | `/v1/partner/me`              | The signed-in staff member and partner                       |
| POST   | `/v1/partner/vouchers/check`  | Both codes; shows the offer. Same failure for any wrong code |
| POST   | `/v1/partner/vouchers/accept` | Both codes, reference, requestId; single use, retry-safe     |
| GET    | `/v1/partner/vouchers`        | This partner's accepted vouchers, newest first               |

Cancelling a voucher and refunding its coins is not built yet.

### Where the economy is stored

With `DATABASE_URL` set, players, coins (`PgLedgerStore`), tournaments, entries and vouchers live
in Postgres (`PgEconomyRepository`). Without it, everything lives in memory and is lost on
restart. The services only see the `EconomyRepository` interface in
`apps/api/src/economy/stores.ts`, so both stores behave the same.

- Writes that move coins run in the same database transaction as the ledger postings.
- Joining locks the tournament row first, so two players cannot take the last seat.
- Redeeming locks the offer row, so the last voucher in stock cannot be issued twice.
- Lock, cancel and settle re-check the tournament under its row lock, so two instances never
  process it twice.
- Demo voucher offers are seeded on boot. An offer that already exists keeps its remaining
  stock.

Migration `0001_economy_in_postgres` makes player, tournament and entry ids text (player ids
come from sign-in, tournament ids are readable and deterministic), keeps the squad on each entry,
and keeps the partner and category on each issued voucher.

## Database

```bash
docker compose up -d
pnpm --filter @season/api db:migrate     # apply migrations; run before the first start
pnpm --filter @season/api db:generate    # after editing apps/api/src/db/schema.ts
```

CI fails if `schema.ts` changes without a matching migration. The Postgres tests (ledger
concurrency and retries, feed sync, the economy store, and tournaments and vouchers end to end)
run with:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://season:season@localhost:5432/season_challenger pnpm --filter @season/api test:db
```

## Checks

```bash
pnpm format:check
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm --filter @season/api test:db   # needs DATABASE_URL and migrated Postgres
```

The same checks run in GitHub Actions on every push to `main`.
